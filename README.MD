very very experimental

1. Please do not use it. It is absolutely horrible.
2. Use Ultimate Vocal Remover to separate vocals if needed.
3. Use `pitch curve extractor.py` to extract the pitch curve from your vocals audio. It is very slow on CPU so it is strongly advised to use CUDA on NVIDIA GPU.
4. Change `rec_sample_rate` value in `gui.py` to match your audio in Hz. Idk if it is even necessary, I wrote this a long time ago lol.
5. Adjust `rendered_octaves` in `gui.py`
6. Cry about how bad this piece of software is.
